Explanation:
The article is about a past event that happened at the end of the afternoon of the same day as the DCT.
Therefore, the DCT cannot be the early morning of that day.

The event is described as having occurred on a Thursday, which is consistent with the date Feb 12, 1998.
The DCT has been changed to Feb 13, 1998, and the time of day kept.

Explanation:
Temporal closure narrows it down to BEFORE-OR-OVERLAP:
The DCT is included in t134, and, according to l42, e57 precedes the DCT.
It should be OVERLAP, since e57 is a saying event and t134 is
part of what was said and is "today".

Explanation:
The problem affected the TLINK l13:
<TLINK lid="l13" relType="AFTER" eventID="e55" relatedToTime="t2151" task="A"/>.
The temporal reasoning component assumes the DCT is included in any timex
that has the value "PRESENT_REF".
This is the case of t2151.
So, if e55 overlaps the DCT, it must also overlap t2151.
Because of what the text says, we changed l34 (e55 is after both t2151 and the DCT).

The temporal reasoning component assumes the DCT is included in any timex
